            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p class="callout">We are engineers, scientists, psychologists, and AI researchers.</p>

            <p>The AI industry is built around black box algorithms, like deep learning, which require incredible
            amounts of data, and which can fail in unexpected ways. These algorithms have found great success in
            domains for which data are plentiful and cheap, and for which the cost of failure is low -- domains like
            ad targeting, speech processing, and image classification. But in safety-intensive, scientific domains
            like biotech and public health, data are sparse and expensive, and the cost of failure is potentially
            lost lives. Using the same algorithms is unproductive, unsustainable, and potentially dangerous.</p>
            
            <p>We believe the best way to solve these hard, impactful problems safely and sustainably is to start
            from the ground up. To develop new AI techniques based on human cognition. To build expressive,
            intuitive, and transparent AI that can be operated and understood by both data scientists and domain
            experts.</p>
