      <h2>Redpoll <span class="crimson">Plover</span> bolts on to your data warehouse to find and fix bad data and to

      <!-- <p> -->
      <!-- The AI industry is built around black box algorithms, like deep learning, which require incredible amounts of -->
      <!-- data, and which can fail in unexpected ways. These algorithms have found great success in domains for which data -->
      <!-- are plentiful and cheap, and for which the cost of failure is low &mdash; domains like ad targeting, image -->
      <!-- classification, chatbots, and content generation. But in safety-intensive domains like healthcare, defense, and -->
      <!-- public policy, data are sparse and expensive, and the cost of failure is potentially lost lives. Using the same -->
      <!-- algorithms is unproductive, unsustainable, and dangerous.</p> -->
      <!-- <p> -->
      <!-- We believe the best way to solve these hard, impactful problems safely and sustainably is to start from the -->
      <!-- ground up. To develop new AI techniques based on human cognition. To build expressive, intuitive, and -->
      <!-- transparent AI that can be operated and understood by both data scientists and domain experts. <span -->
      <!-- class="crimson">That's why we founded Redpoll.</span> -->

      <!-- <h2>Redpoll is the first ML platform that builds a Bayesian model of your relational databse to fully understand -->
      <!-- the world -->
      <!-- according to your data.</h2> -->
