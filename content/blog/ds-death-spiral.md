After five years in development, a multi-million dollar decision support project is patently ignored by decision-makers.
A nine-figure data-science company lays off 60% of its workforce as it has failed for the past two years to develop a machine learning model that can help its target market.
A hospital scrubs its efforts to integrate clinical support software after failing to make useful recommendations, more than three years and $60 million later.
These are not uncommon realities of the Machine Learning industries today.

The data science process is hard.
Its processes are inefficient, error-prone, and fragile.
It is full of iteration and cycles: we do not like what we are producing, so we take a few steps back, tweak, and try again.
Every step requires communication with subject area experts and stakeholders; it requires those subject area experts to stop their forward momentum to ensure our work does not make faulty assumptions.
It requires careful archival and documentation of all previous steps to ensure reproducibility, so we can continually progress toward the goal and avoid tripping over our past failures.
Cycles are fragile. Every cycle presents an opportunity for the process to fail.
This fragility incurs a great deal of unnecessary waste, from the support work required for infrastructure and ML platforms' management to domain-specific ML solutions.

# The standard data science process: CRISP-DM

If you are a data scientist, you probably use an analytics process called [*Cross-industry standard process for data mining*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining) or CRISP-DM.
You might not be aware what you do is called "CRISP-DM", but this is how everybody does analytics because it is the only workflow that makes sense with today's machine learning technology. It goes like this:

<style>
    .row {
        padding: 1rem 0;
        align-items: center;
    }

    .col-left {
        background-color: #f2f2f2;
    }

    .col-right {
        padding: 1rem;
    }
</style>

Things to note:
- People are doing much of the required procedure, not AI.
- It takes a significant amount of iterative work to answer a single question.
- Sometimes you cannot answer the question because the information does not exist in the data.
- There are nearly as many paths back as there are paths forward.
- The question you end up answering is frequently not the one you set out to answer.
<!-- - Not pictured: all the people you have to bother to get things right. -->

The process eventually begins to resemble a game of *Chutes and Ladders*.
If you are lucky, you will always progress &mdash; up the ladders &mdash; toward an answer.
However, we inevitably step into one of the many modeling pitfalls &mdash; falling down chutes &mdash; having to iterate and try again.
By this design, we put ourselves at the risk of more of these chutes than is strictly necessary.

To compound the issue: in complex domains, like health and biotech, where there is extensive science involved and high cost for failure, domain experts *must* be involved in every step of the process (apart from training).
Each step requires e-mailing an expert, scheduling time &mdash; days or weeks out &mdash; for them to stop what they are doing, and then sitting down with them, to tell you what is wrong and what is right.
If this is too-often occurring, there are costs of compounding interruptions, increasing chances of potentially dangerous mistakes, and loss of confidence. 

## The Death Spiral

The whole data science cycle is rough, but the model - train - validate process is a Death Spiral.
This cycle is where I have seen the most data science projects "go off the rails".
Many aspects converge to make the process particularly nasty, but most of the trouble is in measuring and maximizing performance.

Machine learning does not give you a good way to know whether your question is answerable with your data or how well you should expect to do.
The first time you try a model, you are likely to fail.
Your options are then to find a model that will work or prove that no model will work.
You must succeed, or you must prove unicorns do not exist.
Under some circumstances, even if you have the math and the problem is well-behaved, you may be able to prove that modeling is impossible.
Nevertheless, in my experience (much to my dismay), mathematical proof is not compelling to stakeholders.
People want and understand empirical results.
In practice, the only way to prove that no model will work &mdash; or no model will work better &mdash; is by deduction, to try *everything*.

Due to sheer combinatorics, there is no shortage of things to try.
And since none of them quite fit your question and your data, there is always something to blame.
"Well, this model does not work well with categorical data, so maybe we could try a different encoding or embedding", "This deep network only has two layers, so it's probably not very expressive", or "We have a lot of missing data, and we've only tried this one imputation method".

With each modeling choice, you must explain it to â€” and get the thumbs up from â€” a subject area expert.
Communication becomes a bottleneck.
As a result, there are two communication pitfalls:
1. You communicate properly, as frequently as CRISP-DM demands, dragging out your process out by months (or longer)
1. You do not communicate and deliver something likely to fail or to be rejected by decision-makers. This can be because they do not understand or don't want it (because they haven't been included) or even because the machine learning aspect is opaque.

As a result of all of this, it is common for data science projects to be shelved after months or even _years_ of investment and development.

### So why does the data science Death Spiral exist? 

The Data Science Death Spiral exists because machine learning is, and always has been, focused on modeling questions.
What is the value of Y given X?
Which data are similar?
What factors determine Z?
Machine learning assumes the user has a well-defined problem with nice, neat, and complete data.
This is rarely the case.
> **Your problem is more nuanced than you think and your data are gross**.

Because machine learning focuses on modeling individual questions, the standard data science process must focus on modeling questions; so the standard process is good when you have a well-defined problem and nice data.
It is bad when you have a nebulous problem and ugly data, and is disastrous when exploring.
> **Since this CRISP-DM process is tragically inept at exploration, it is tragically unfit for innovation because innovation comes from exploration.**

# A better data science process through humanistic systems

People do not model questions.
You do not have to know what you want to learn before you learn it.
You go out in the world, you observe data, and learn from those data.
You learn about the process that produced the data: the _world_.

What if we had machine learning or artificial intelligence technology focused on modeling the **whole data** rather than just modeling single questions?
We would be able to answer any number of questions within the realm of our data without re-training or re-validating.
We would know which questions we'd be able to answer and how well.

The data science process would look like this:

    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm col-right">
        <p style="font-size:150%;">Ask a question.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class=row>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm col-left">
        <img src="/img/workflows/human-04.png" style="max-width: 200px;">
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm col-right">
        <p style="font-size:150%;">Ask more questions.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class=row>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm col-left">
        <img src="/img/workflows/human-05.png" style="max-width: 200px;">
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm col-right">
        <p style="font-size:150%;">Report to stakeholders.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class=row>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm col-left">
        <img src="/img/workflows/human-06.png" style="max-width: 240px;">
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm col-right">
        <p style="font-size:150%;">Ask their questions.</p>
    </div>
</div>

The first thing to notice is that there are far fewer steps and that every step takes us closer to where we want to be.
The key in this process is asking sensible questions.
Asking sensible questions requires deep domain expertise, so it would be most effective for this Data Science process to be run by a domain expert.

Eliminating iteration through up-front learning and turning a *question-modeling* system into a *question-answering* system significantly reduces discovery and production time.
Under this process, discovery-to-production takes hours or days rather than months or years.

**And the best part is: this technology exists today. You can check out what this looks like in practice <span style="color: crimson">[here](@/redpoll-vs-ml.md)</span> and <span style="color: crimson">[here](@/blog/gamma.md)</span>.**

When we consult for clients, we take their data, feed it through Reformer, and wait until the client has an hour or so to sit with us.
Then we let them do our job for us.
We sit and translate their questions into Reformer language (which they could do with a bit of training) and get feedback in real-time.

It sounds like a racket, but I do not have 20 years of experience in orthopedics, aircraft maintenance, or plant breeding to call upon, so I do not know which questions to ask or which insights are potentially novel.
It would be arrogant to think that I, a layperson, could solve these problems by blinding throwing AI at data.

## Limitations of the humanistic approach

We built Reformer on humanistic AI.
Humanistic AI allows us to chew through analyses.
It is especially powerful for discovery and green-fielding: getting answers from your data when there is no preexisting model or no satisfactory preexisting model.
If you are considering dropping a dataset into a random forest or neural net to see what comes out, your experience would be much improved using a humanistic AI system.
That said, there are situations when you might want to go another route.

The humanistic approach is fast because it is flexible, and it is flexible because it makes few assumptions.
This is how it can go from nothing to a causal model.
A model that makes strong assumptions (that are also correct) will provide a better account for the data.
This property is the [no free lunch theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_in_search_and_optimization).
However, developing that robust model takes a lot of science and iteration.
The humanistic approach can get you 90% of the way thereby allowing you to check your modeling assumptions before you start modeling.

# Wrapping up

Data science is a difficult process.
Creating production models takes much effort from several people and significant IT resources.
Data science is also a wasteful process because you can never know 1) whether what you want to do is possible or 2) whether the result will be accepted/trusted by the stakeholder.

The primary contributor to data science's difficulty and wastefulness is: machine learning structures lend themselves to inefficient modeling approaches.
Machine learning only models specific questions, which places unreasonable demands on the practitioner.
These demands are namely, the model, well-behaved, complete data, and the underlying question is well-formed.
Alternatively, humanistic systems model data, which allows the user flexibility in both the state of the data and the statement &mdash; or existence &mdash; of the question.
The result is the elimination of the vast majority of backtracking and iteration.


# Key points

- The standard data science process, CRISP-DM, is slow and wasteful. It has as many paths away from answers as toward them; and has cycles where the process breaks down.
- CRISP-DM's design was meant to compensate for today's inadequate machine learning models.
- Today's machine learning is question-oriented rather than data-oriented; therefore one machine learning model can answer one question.
- Data-oriented, humanistic AI enables a much simpler workflow in which all paths point toward answers, and the only cycle is answering more questions.
- The humanistic workflow enables _immediate_ ask-and-answer capabilities, enabling stakeholders to directly engage in the discovery process.
