<!--Note to self: do not alienate people in domains that "don't matter" -->

Today's AI has made a lot of impact in domains like ad delivery, product recommendation, image classification, and game playing, but it is no secret that it has struggled in domains like health care, biotechnology, agriculture, defense, intelligence, law, and public policy. The reason is simple: today's AI is fundamentally incompatible with these domains. In these domains, people end up working to support AI, when it should really be the other way around. In this post we'll discuss why AI is failing and why the AI community at large seems unequipped to fix it.

# A brief history of Artificial Intelligence

For a more in-depth explanation of the history (and failures) of AI research community [click here](#). I'll give a summary of AI summers and winters here.

1. The Dartmouth workshop
2. Summer 1
3. Winter 1
4. Summer 2
5. Winter 2 and the word machine learning
6. Summer 3 (back prop and deep learning)

## And editorial look at history

1. Automating human decisions. Was not meant to solve real problems. was a toy.
2. Unbounded arrogance

# (Some of) The problems with today's AI and how we got them

## The brain as an abstration

## Minimizing prediction error as a goal

## Ignoring the (real) user

# AI today

## Succeeding at making you miserable

## The silent revival of expert systems



- Who is this for:
    + People who are irked about their AI/DS projects failing and not knowing why
- What is the goal
    + get them to resent today's AI
- How do we do that
    + explaining that AI is not suitable for important tasks
    + same pitch as always: data hungry, opaque, brittle
