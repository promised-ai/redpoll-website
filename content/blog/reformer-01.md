Reformer is Redpoll's *Humanistic* Artificial Intelligence platform. In this
post we will discuss Reformer's capabilities at a high level by charting the
creation and propagation for information through the system.

# The Reformer architecture

At the center of Reformer is a [Humanistic Artificial
Intelligence](@/blog/humanistic-ai.md) engine. Humanistic AI, in short, is an
AI system that provably mimics human cognitive capabilities and knowledge
structure. AI that works at the level of cognition interacts better with
people. Humanistic capabilities gives the Reformer core other capabilities that
make it safer, more flexible, and able to deliver information faster than other
systems.

1. Data stream to the core inference engine by way of a data pipeline.
2. The always-on inference engine integrates data into its knowledge
    + Optionally, the core may decide that the data represent an anomaly or an
        attack, and should be rejected and rerouted.
3. Information generated by the core inference engine is immediately available
to all end-users via dashboards, deployed models, interactive clients, etc
4. The model continues to think and to introspect

## Streaming data

The data at any active organization is a stream. If your organization is not
generating data, it cannot generate information. If your organization is not
generating information, it cannot solve new problems. To enable continuous
information delivery and continuous innovation, an AI system must thrive in a
streaming data environment. Reformer is able to integrate new data, edit
existing data, and fill in missing entries without retraining.

## Always-on inference (mulling it over)

Today's Neural AI architecture *learns* by algorithms that search for a
performance peak. Imagine a blindfolded mountain climber dropped at some random
location in the Himalayas looking to summit Mt. Everest using the following
rule: *Always go up, never go down*. The climber will summit a peak, but it is
likely to be the highest.

Reformer explores. Reformer has a different goal: to chart the mountain range.
To this end, Reformer sends out armies of cartographer-climbers. The peaks are
easy to find. But what is beyond, hidden on far side? Like us, Reformer
considers its observations. And like us, it can be enlightened by exploring odd
ideas. So, Reformer never sleeps. It mulls things over when it is not handing
new inputs, Because we do not want to miss out on these *Eureka!* moments.

## Intuitive information structure

The learning goal of Reformer is not to minimize the error of a specific
prediction; it is to minimize the information in the world (as defined by the
data stream). Like a person, its goal is never to be surprised. Reformer
attempts to recreate a model of the process that generated the data set.

Reformer represents its knowledge in a general, intuitive structure. It makes
very few assumptions about the data. It learns which data features are related
to which others and characterizes the form of that relationship.

## Introspection and self-awareness

Having access to an intuitive representation of knowledge allows Reformer to
make intuitive judgments about the state of its knowledge, and to share those
judgments with its users. Reformer can characterize and quantify its
uncertainty, identify anomalous data before they corrupt a system, and
attribute longer-term changes in it knowledge brought about by changes in the
data-generating process. Reformer generates information about information. This
means that if something happens that changes how or why your deployed models
perform, Reformer will let you know.

Reformer can:
- Tell you when it is likely to fail or succeed
- Tell you what experiments to run or data to collect to fill knowledge gaps
- Tell you which data are likely errors or attacks
- Tell you when and how the world (the data generating process) changes

And not only can Reformer tell you these things, it can tell you why.
