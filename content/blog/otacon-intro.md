Redpoll and Rutgers University have entered into a 42-month collaborative
agreement with DARPA to develop OTACON, a introspective AI system that thrives in
dynamic, uncertain worlds. The agreement falls under the Science of Artificial
Intelligence and Learning for Open-world Novelty (SAIL-ON) program, which aims
to move AI systems out of closed-world problems with static constraints, into
open worlds with dynamic constraints.

OTACON will solve this problem by making AI introspective and malleable.

> OTACON will solve this problem by being introspective and malleable. Whenever it sees something new it asks itself, “does this make sense given what I currently  believe?” If “no”, the machine will adapt. It determines where its knowledge has broken and why, and rearranges its structure to preserve the still useful knowledge and override the outdated knowledge.

> Reliable introspection requires interpretable knowledge. The system is built on our research in cognitive science, so it learns and store its knowledge like people do, which means that everything the machine knows can be communicated to, and scrutinized by the human user.

FIXME. Something about partnerting wit humans

The first phase of the SAIL-ON program began December 3rd and will end FIXME.
Eaves and Shafto say they will be publishing throughout the program.
