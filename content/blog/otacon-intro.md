Redpoll and Rutgers University have entered into a 42-month collaborative agreement with DARPA to develop OTACON, an introspective AI system that thrives in dynamic, uncertain worlds. The agreement falls under the Science of Artificial Intelligence and Learning for Open-world Novelty (SAIL-ON) program, which aims to move AI systems out of closed-world problems with static constraints, into open worlds with dynamic constraints.

OTACON will solve this problem by making AI introspective and malleable. According to Co-PI, Dr. Baxter Eaves:

> OTACON is introspective and malleable. Whenever it sees something new it asks itself, "does this make sense given what I currently know?" If "no", the machine will adapt. It determines where its knowledge has broken and why, and rearranges its structure to override the old outdated knowledge while preserving the still useful knowledge.

Eaves says OTACON is just one set of capabilities Redpoll is developing toward building machines that are partners to humans, not just tools.

> Novelty is in the eye of the beholder. And because we want our systems to be interpretable and intuitive to humans &dash; so they can work with humans &mdash; we have used our research in human cognition to ensure that OTACON can learn and store its knowledge similar to the ways people do.

The first phase of the SAIL-ON program began December 3rd and will end FIXME.

Redpoll's mission, says Eaves, is "...to make machines the are safe and reliable partners to human decision makers, not just tools". To learn more about Redpoll's AI philosophy and platform capabilities, visit [www.redpoll.ai/#about](http://www.redpoll.ai/#about)
